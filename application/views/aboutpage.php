    <!-- Umbrella Corporation description -->
    <h2>Umbrella Corporation</h2>
    <p>Umbrella was a giant conglomerate which operated ruthlessly as a major international player in a number of markets; including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, as well as top-secret operations utilizing genetic engineering and biological weaponry. The company also had a more benevolent public face for the ignorant masses, producing cosmetics, consumer products and foods.
        A subsidiary of Umbrella Corporation operated as a malevolent paramilitary organization. This division of the company maintained a highly trained security force capable of rescue, performing reconnaissance, and conducting all paramilitary operations. They used a variety of vehicles, including HUMVEEs. Complementing this security force was an air wing, which maintained a fleet of UH-60 Black Hawks, AV-8 Harrier VTOL jets, C-130 Hercules water-landing capable cargo planes, CH-53 Sea Stallion cargo helicopters for transporting prisoners and AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters. The company utilized these resources in order to secure and protect its assets, as well as its high-profile employees.</p>
